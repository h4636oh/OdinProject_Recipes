    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This homemade garlic naan recipe is cooked in a hot cast iron skillet rather than a tandoor oven, <br>
        like restaurant naan. When cooked at the proper temperature, naan develops blistered bubbles with <br>
        a lovely golden-black char. Reward yourself for a job well done by sopping the bread in copious <br>
        amounts of curry.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup warm water, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 cups bread flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>¼ cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped cilantro (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water, sugar, and yeast in a bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and forms a creamy foam,<br>
            about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat butter in a pan over medium heat until melted and sizzling. Quickly mix in garlic and remove<br>
            from the heat.</li>
        <li>Add bread flour, yogurt, salt, and 1 tablespoon garlic butter to yeast mixture; stir with a wooden<br>
            spoon until a shaggy dough forms. Knead by hand until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl, <br>
            adding more water or flour as needed. Turn dough out onto the counter and continue kneading until it <br>
            forms a smooth ball, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place dough into a large bowl and drizzle a few spoons garlic butter over top. Cover and let rise until <br>
            doubled in volume, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Punch dough down and turn out onto the counter. Shape into a rough rectangle and cut into 6 pieces. <br>
            Roll each piece into a ball and lightly dust with flour. Cover with plastic wrap and proof until <br>
            slightly puffy, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat a cast iron skillet over medium heat until very hot, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, roll each piece proofed dough into a 1/8-inch-thick oval. Sprinkle some cilantro on <br>
            top and press lightly to adhere.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, cook naan in the hot skillet until large bubbles form, 1 to 2 minutes. <br>
            Flip, press gently, and continue to cook until bubbles on the bottom are charred, 2 to 3 <br>
            minutes more.</li>
        <li>Brush naan with more garlic butter before serving.</li>
    </ol>

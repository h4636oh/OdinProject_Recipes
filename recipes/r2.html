    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Give this chana masala dish a try and don't look back. <br>
        Indian food is not just curried sauces. <br>
        This spin on an Indian chickpea curry features a healthy mixture of <br>
        chickpeas, tomatoes, onion, and spices. Both carnivores and vegetarians will enjoy this meal. <br>
        My kids love it. Leave out the green chile if the kiddies will be eating.<br>
        Serve over basmati or jasmine rice and enjoy. Namaste y'all!

        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 fresh bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Grind onion, tomato, ginger, garlic, and chile pepper together in a food processor into a paste.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry bay leaves in hot oil until fragrant, about <br>
            30 seconds. Pour the paste into the skillet and cook until the oil begins to separate from the mixture <br>
            and is golden brown in color, 2 to 3 minutes. Season the mixture with chili powder, coriander, gram <br>
            masala, turmeric, and salt; cook and stir until very hot, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir enough water into the mixture to get a thick gravy; bring to a boil and stir chickpeas into the <br>
            gravy. Reduce heat to medium and cook until the chickpeas are heated through, 5 to 7 minutes. Garnish <br>
            with cilantro.</li>
